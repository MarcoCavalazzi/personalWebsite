								<h3>The Ironman</h3>
                                
Merging computer science and robotics with the <a href="energy.html">new energy source</a>, the Ironman suit is the advancement we need to help both civilians and astronauts to resist to harsh environments and lift heavy weights both at work or during rescue missions (e.g. to save people trapped after an earthquake). Plus, it's darn cool!<br/>
                                The biggest challenges to build it are:<br/>
                                - How should it execute any movement? What is the input here? What is the output?<br/>
                                - Can we multiply the strength of the user? If so, what approach works best?<br/>
                                - How do we make it fly?<br/>
                                - Lastly, is it possible to build Jarvis?<br/>
                                <br/>
                                <strong>Let's move</strong><br/>
                                <br/>
In order to realize robotic movements we can use the so called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuator" target="_blank">actuators</a>". We can use those to move the suit and multiply the strength of the user. Some examples have already been realized: see name or name experiments (MIT and guy that lifts heavy weights). Yes, the movements may not be very fluid, yet they do their job, so it's just a matter of tuning the settings to make the exoskeleton move as wanted.<br/>
What is important here is to decide how to read the input, the will of the user to move in one direction or the other. It can be done using pressure sensors. They are cheap enough and easy to find or realize. This solution, though, would make it impossible to, for example, lay an arm on the table during a break, because the sensors around the suit would feel the arm trying to move downwards (hello gravity!), so the actuators would react by moving the arm in that direction. 
Take a look at <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/this-engineering-student-from-kerela-built-a-working-ironman-suit-in-just-rs-50-000-259905.html" target="_blank">Vimal</a> with his prototype. <br/>
Muscle sensors, on the other hand, would leave the arm where it stands as long as the muscle is relaxed. Those sensors are more reliable, but at the same time need to be placed in contact with the arm all the time. To do so we could attach them with sticky patches or use non-glued reusable patches while keeping them in place with an elastic band.<br/>
After this, we have to choose what kind of actuator we need to use to realize the right output. There are affordable actuators that use electricity to work but they move slowly. Another kind of actuator works with compressed air and creates a considerable force, but needs considerable energy, together with an air compressor, which is usually pretty big and not easy to carry around. Plus, it needs tubes to direct the air and this introduces a vulnerability in the system. It doesn't seem practical.<br/>
In my opinion, a good actuator should work on electricity only, limiting the potential vulnerability of the system and, thus, guaranteeing the highest reliability. This brings out a problem: where do we find or, better, how do we build powerful electric actuators?<br/>
<br/>
                                <strong>To the sky!</strong><br/>
<br/>
After that, we will want the suit to fly. Otherwise, it wouldn't be that useful... There are many ways to make it fly but only few are feasible as portable devices. The ideal solution involves no combustion, since it would mean limited autonomy. Plus, combustion would introduce a high risk of explosion and we know that even for the best of the best something can go wrong, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13" target="_blank">Apollo 13</a>. Combustion aside, we could use blades, like those used on helicopters. Electrically powered and effective, but... it wouldn't be that cool to see someone fly with a blade on his head or hands, would it?<br/>
My idea right now is to use turbines to compress air and expel it at a higher pressure, like in everyday airplanes, yet I would prefer to avoid having combustion inside the air turbine. To do this we could use electric ducted fans or propellers. What we need is to make those powerful enough to generate enough thrust, using the right materials and handling the many problems that could arise while powering them up.
Even if it works as expected, potentially allowing a man to fly, it would still be a great challenge to create a suit that could make it easy for the user to steer a little and change path without losing control or steering to much, thus going in stall (and probably losing conscience if flying at high speed). The suit would also need to be built in a way that allows the user to stay relaxed while the suit keeps arms and legs straight during flight. Otherwise all the thrust generated by the turbines would reflec badly on the body.<br/>
<br/>
                                <strong>AI - Artificial Intelligence</strong><br/>
<br/>
Regarding Jarvis, the AI that assists Mr. Stark, there are many ways to realize that and many people and companies are already working on that. Personally, I found a useful service called <a href="https://recast.ai/" target="_blank">Recast.AI</a> which I am confident could provide, if well customized, a close-enough copy of the original. There is also an SDK for <a href="https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Android#usage" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-iOS" target="_blank">iOS</a>, which allows the service to work just fine even when Wi-Fi is not available, exploiting mobile data connections. The system could be installed on a mobile device carried in the armour and kept charged by the same energy source that powers up the whole suit, together with a second one as backup.
