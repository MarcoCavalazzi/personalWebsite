                                <p>
                                    30 December 2016<br/><br/>
                                    The world needs to start takling the problem of garbage disposal. I mean, sometimes we can recycle and sometimes we cannot. It's cool to recycle, but sometimes it's hard. So what happens? We burn it or we hide it underground. The first option creates pollution (creating cancer causing stuff like dioxin) and the second one doesn't solve the problem, it hides it. Now, as far as I know hiding a problem is the habit of the weak and we already have enough pollution around to be wanting to create more of it. 
                                    So? So we need to handle the wastes that cannot be recycled with plasma, so to avoid producing any more dioxin and, in the meantime, study how to actually recycle everything, since it is stupid to waste anything when the resources at our disposal are limited. The Earths gives us a lot, let's handle it wisely.
                                    <br/>
                                    Another big issue that we could solve in a moment, if willing to do so, is the production of water anytime and anywhere needed through the harvest of humidity in the air. We already have small devices that can fill water bottles. They do need energy to work, but we have renewable energy so... what exactly is stopping us from making them bigger in Africa and in the deserts? Politics? Stupidity?
                                    <br/>
                                    After this we should really improve our ability to produce food without the need to use so many fields. We talk about overpopulation, but the main problem here is the waste of space. We already know how to cultivate crops without the need for soil or even the Sun. Let's try to grow using a multilevel architecture that can produce 10 with a terrain for 1, so that everyone on the planet can be fed. 
                                    This step will be fundamental in order to understand how to handle the colonization of other planets, like Mars.

								<p>
                                    30 November 2016<br/><br/>
								    From my point of view the world is late. I know it sound strange, but think about it. We have all the technology to make this world fair and plentiful for everyone, but we struggle to avoid starting a new war for raw materials and other resources. Instead of focusing our efforts in making the best of what we have, governments steal others' resources to go on. Take Costa Rica, a country smaller than Switzerland that runs on clean energy. How comes that they can do it and the USA don't?<br/>
